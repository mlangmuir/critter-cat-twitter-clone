# Critter: A Cat-Themed Twitter Clone

This cat Twitter clone was my first React project. It was done as part of my Diploma of Web Development program at Concordia University. For the project, I developed the frontend from scratch, whereas the backend was provided for us. I faced many challenges throughout the project, including using URL params to fetch user profile data from the backend and using context providers to make functions and variables available globally.

The project is not currently hosted but I have uploaded a video demo of my work at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFCoq1W97zI&ab_channel=MatthewLangmuir

## Development

### Frontend
To run this app on the client side, you must first install `yarn` and ensure that you have the following dependencies:
- styled-components
- react-router-dom@5.3.0
- react-icons
- moment

Once your dependencies are install, you can navigate to the `client` folder by typing `cd client` in the terminal and then type `yarn start` to start the application.

## Backend
Navigate to the `server` folder by typing `cd server` in the terminal and then type `yarn start:server` to start up the server.
